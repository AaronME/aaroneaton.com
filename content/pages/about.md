## Writer

Do I write science fiction? I wear a watch that Dick Tracy never dreamed of and I'm typing this on a device that would look at home on Captain Picard's desk. I write fiction about people trying to make sense of a world that runs on science.

## Engineer

I'm a kubernetes fan boy and I _will_ talk about it at parties if not monitored.

I've worked with a lot of great people on projects like [Call of Duty: Elite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Elite), [Society6](https://society6.com), [Procore](https://procore.com), and [Upbound](https://upbound.io/), the company behind the open source [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io) project.

I am happiest when working on projects that empower others to transform inspiration into contribution.

## Roustabout

In 2009, I ran away with the circus. For a little over a year I was a stagehand with Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey's _Red Unit_. My tour was the 139th edition of the show. They called it _Zing, Zang, Zoom!_ It was a one-of-a-kind experience, and it utterly changed my life.
